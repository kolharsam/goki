# goki

A toy non-persistent Key-Value data store

### Main Components

- `Server` - is a webserver that you can start with the command `goki-server start 8080`
- `Client` - is a REPL client that connects to the `goki-server`. Usage: `goki-client connect 8080`

##### TODOs

- [ ] Make Client REPL
- [ ] Client Connects with server
- [ ] Fixed Request and Response types
- [ ] Add support for commands like `get` & `set` to start off
- [ ] Add health check flag for client

More information will be updated here soon.
